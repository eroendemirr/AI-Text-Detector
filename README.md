# AI Text Detector

This project aims to detect whether a given text was written by a human or generated by an AI model. It uses the Naive Bayes classification algorithm along with basic natural language processing techniques.

## Features

- Text classification using Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Training on labeled text data (`human` vs `AI`)
- Prediction function to classify new input text
- Accuracy and classification report generation

## Dataset

The dataset is expected to be in a CSV format named `data.csv`, with the following columns:

- `text`: The input text data
- `label`: The corresponding label (`human` or `AI`)

## Installation

Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
